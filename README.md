# QRAM
10 qubit QRAM for basis encoding.

The QRAM is designed for 10 qubits using 10+2 qubits. The circuit
can be further extended to store $2^{n}$  quantum states using 
$n+2$ qubits. The additional 2 qubit is used to specify the amplitude
of each quantum state by a controlled unitary operator.

This circuit is designed for storing two 10 bit quantum states  with amplitude
 $\textstyle\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ in qiskit.
