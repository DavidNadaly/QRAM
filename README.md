# QRAM
QRAM for amplitude encoding.

The QRAM is designed for 10 qubits using 10+2 qubits. The circuit
can be further extended to store $2^{n}$  quantum states using 
$n+2$ qubits. 2 qubit unitary gate is used to specify the amplitude
of each quantum state.

This circuit is designed for storing two quantum states  with amplitude
 $\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}$
